features:

 * zero downtime code deployment
 * ability to change environment variables of workers with zero downtime
 * resuscitation - when a worker dies it is restarted
 * redirect worker stdout and stderr to rotating gzipped log files
 * runs as daemon, providing ability to start and stop

usage:

    To use naught, your node.js server has 2 requirements.
    
    1. Once the server is fully booted and is readily accepting connections,

           process.send('online');

       Usually this is done in the `listening` event for a node server, for
       example:

           server = http.createServer(...);
           server.listen(80, function () {
               process.send('online');
           });

    2. Listen to the `shutdown` message and shutdown gracefully. This message
       is emitted after there is already a newer instance of your server
       online and taking care of business:

           process.on('message', function(message) {
               if (message === 'shutdown') {
                   performCleanup();
                   process.exit(0);
               }
           });

       If your server has no long-lived connections, you may skip this step.
       However, note that most node.js apps do have long lived connections.
       In fact, by default, the connection: keep-alive header is sent with
       every request.

       When you receive the `shutdown` message, either close all open
       connections or call `process.exit()`.


CLI:

    naught start [options] server.js [script-options]

        Starts server.js as a daemon passing script-options as command
        line arguments.

        Each worker's stdout and stderr are redirected to a log files
        specified by the `stdout` and `stderr` parameters. When a log file
        becomes larger than `max-log-size`, the log file is renamed using the
        current date and time, and a new log file is opened.

        With naught, you can use `console.log` and friends. Because naught
        pipes the output into a log file, node.js treats stdout and stderr
        as asynchronous streams.

        Creates an `ipc-file` which naught uses to communicate with your
        server once it has started.

        Available options and their defaults:

        --worker-count 1
        --ipc-file naught.ipc
        --log naught.log
        --stdout stdout.log
        --stderr stderr.log
        --max-log-size 10485760
        --cwd .


    naught stop [options] [ipc-file]

        Stops the running server which created `ipc-file`.
        Uses `naught.ipc` by default.

        This sends the 'shutdown' message to all the workers and waits for
        them to exit gracefully.

        If you specify a timeout, naught will forcefully kill your workers
        if they do not shut down gracefully within the timeout.

        Available options and their defaults:

            --timeout none


    naught status [ipc-file]

        Displays whether a server is running or not.
        Uses `naught.ipc` by default.


    naught deploy [options] [ipc-file]

        Replaces workers with new workers using new code and optionally
        the environment variables from this command.

        Naught spawns all the new workers and waits for them to all become
        online before killing a single old worker. This guarantees zero
        downtime if any of the new workers fail and provides the ability to
        cleanly abort the deployment if it hangs.

        A hanging deploy happens when a new worker fails to emit the 'online'
        message, or when an old worker fails to shutdown upon receiving the
        'shutdown' message. A keyboard interrupt will cause a deploy-abort,
        cleanly and with zero downtime.

        If `timeout` is specified, naught will automatically abort the deploy
        if it does not finish within those seconds.

        If `override-env` is true, the environment varibables that are set with
        this command are used to override the original environment variables
        used with the `start` command. If any variables are missing, the
        original values are left intact.

        Uses `naught.ipc` by default.

        Available options and their defaults:

            --override-env true
            --timeout none


    naught deploy-abort [icp-file]

        Aborts a hanging deploy. A hanging deploy happens when a new worker
        fails to emit the 'online' message, or when an old worker fails
        to shutdown upon receiving the 'shutdown' message.

        When deploying, a keyboard interrupt will cause a deploy-abort,
        so the times you actually have to run this command will be few and
        far between.

        Uses `naught.ipc` by default.
